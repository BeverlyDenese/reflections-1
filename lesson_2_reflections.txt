What happens when you create a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

    When I create a repository, Git creates a directory vhere it will keep track
    of all the versions that I save.  Creating the repository also lets Git know
    that I want all the files in this directory to be tracked together, but
    separately from files in different directories.  If I didn't create the
    repository, Git could create the directory to save the versions in
    automatically, but it wouldn't know which files I wanted to track together
    and which I wanted to track separately.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is an intermediate area where I can add changes before
    committing them to the repository.  This allows me to add changes to the
    staging area one-by-one, then commit them all at once, which makes it easier
    to specify what changes should go into each commit.  That makes the commits
    more valuable, since the commit history is easier to navigate when I create
    one commit per logical change.
