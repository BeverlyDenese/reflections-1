What happens when you create a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

    When I create a repository, Git creates a directory vhere it will keep track
    of all the versions that I save.  Creating the repository also lets Git know
    that I want all the files in this directory to be tracked together, but
    separately from files in different directories.  If I didn't create the
    repository, Git could create the directory to save the versions in
    automatically, but it wouldn't know which files I wanted to track together
    and which I wanted to track separately.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is an intermediate area where I can add changes before
    committing them to the repository.  This allows me to add changes to the
    staging area one-by-one, then commit them all at once, which makes it easier
    to specify what changes should go into each commit.  That makes the commits
    more valuable, since the commit history is easier to navigate when I create
    one commit per logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    If I've made more than one logical change since committing, I can add all
    the changes affected by the first logical change to the staging area, then
    commit those without committing the others.

When would you want to create a new branch, and when would you not?

    I like to use master as a stable version of my code and create a new branch
    when I'm planning on working on something experimental, or that will be
    non-stable for a little while.  That makes it easier to switch back to the
    stable version whenever I need to.  This is particularly helpful when I am
    working with other developers, since the other developers can trust that
    master is stable.  They can always check out my branch if they are
    interested in my experimental changes.

    When I'm working on my own, and I make a change that I do not expect to
    break anything, I frequently don't bother to make another branch.  However,
    making a new branch in Git is so fast and easy that there is really no bad
    time to make a branch, unless I make so many that I cannot keep track of
    them all.
